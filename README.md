# Pandemic_Simulation
Pandemic Simulation with Reinforcement Learning 

## Getting Started

This is an open source pandemic simulation environment for reinforcement learning in Unity with ml-agent integration. This is a dissertation project for University of Sussex Summer Term.

To try out the project you should
*open the "Project" folder in Pandemic_Simulation\ml-agents-release_3\ml-agents-release_3\Project with Unity Editor.
* Play Assets/PandemicSimulation/Scenes/T1.unity

### Prerequisites
This project uses Unity-ml-agent 1.1.0 Release 3
Unity 2919.4.0f1
Anaconda Environment with Python 3.7
Tensorflow 2.2.0
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
